        "Calculus and Analytical Geometry forms the mathematical bedrock for modern science, engineering, and computational modeling. This rigorous curriculum establishes first principles of limits and continuity via epsilon-delta formulations, the Squeeze Theorem, and intermediate value properties. We develop differential calculus from difference quotients through product, quotient, and chain rules, analyzing curve optimization, related rates, and Mean Value Theorems. Integral calculus bridges accumulation via Riemann sums to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, improper integrals, and geometric volume applications. The course advances through infinite series convergence tests, Taylor and Maclaurin expansions, and concludes with Cartesian coordinate geometry and complete conic section classifications."

The course develops multiple integration across Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates using Fubini's Theorem and Jacobian transformations. Finally, vector calculus formalizes line and surface integrals, conservative work fields, and the cornerstone integral theorems—Green's, Gauss's Divergence, and Stokes' Theorems—connecting differential field divergence and curl to macro-scale boundary fluxes across science."

The curriculum explores linear transformations, spectral eigenvalue decompositions, and the Spectral Theorem for symmetric operators. Advanced modules formalize inner product orthogonality, Gram-Schmidt QR factorizations, and least-squares normal equations, culminating in the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis for optimal high-dimensional data reduction and modeling."
