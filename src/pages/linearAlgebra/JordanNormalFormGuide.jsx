                <p>{"Write $J_m(\\lambda)=\\lambda I+N$, where $N^m=0$. Since the two terms commute, for nonnegative integer $k$, $J_m(\\lambda)^k=\\sum_{r=0}^{\\min(k,m-1)}\\binom{k}{r}\\lambda^{k-r}N^r$. The truncation reflects nilpotence, not an approximation. When $k-r=0$, the scalar factor is one, including at $\\lambda=0$."}</p>
                <p>{"For a size-two block with nonzero $\\lambda$, $J^k=\\lambda^kI+k\\lambda^{k-1}N$. Repeated eigenvalues therefore allow polynomial factors in $k$ as well as exponential factors. If $A=PJP^{-1}$, then $A^k=PJ^kP^{-1}$; keep the change-of-basis matrices on the correct sides."}</p>
                <p>{"For differential equations, $e^{tJ}=e^{\\lambda t}\\sum_{r=0}^{m-1}t^rN^r/r!$. A size-two chain produces $te^{\\lambda t}$ as well as $e^{\\lambda t}$. The same structure explains why repeated roots lead to polynomial-times-exponential terms in linear ODE solutions."}</p>
              </TheoryBox>
              <TheoryBox title={"Exact algebra versus numerical computation"}>
                <p>{"Jordan form is valuable for proofs and exact symbolic examples. It is sensitive to perturbations: changing a tiny entry can split a repeated eigenvalue or change block sizes. An apparent zero computed by rounding is not enough evidence for an exact chain or rank defect."}</p>
                <p>{"For floating-point computations, a Schur decomposition is usually preferable to constructing an exact Jordan structure. It uses a unitary similarity to triangular form, avoiding the demand to classify unstable block sizes. Use exact arithmetic in the worked Jordan examples, and distinguish exact nullspaces from numerical rank decisions."}</p>
                <p>{"Common mistakes include equating algebraic multiplicity with the number of blocks, using $\\ker(A)$ instead of $\\ker(A-\\lambda I)$, reversing chain order, and treating $P$ as orthogonal without proof. The check $AP=PJ$, together with $\\det P\\ne0$, catches many of these errors."}</p>

              <TheoryBox title={"When diagonalization runs out of eigenvectors"}>
                <p>{"Diagonalization $A=PDP^{-1}$ requires a basis of ordinary eigenvectors. A repeated eigenvalue need not prevent diagonalization; failure occurs when its eigenspace has dimension smaller than its algebraic multiplicity. Jordan form fills the missing directions with generalized eigenvectors rather than pretending additional ordinary eigenvectors exist."}</p>
                <p>{"Over $\\mathbb C$, every square matrix is similar to a block-diagonal Jordan matrix $J$. A block $J_m(\\lambda)$ has $\\lambda$ on the diagonal, ones immediately above it, and zeros elsewhere. Its size measures how long a generalized-eigenvector chain is needed. The blocks are unique up to ordering, but the vectors forming a Jordan basis need not be unique."}</p>
                <p>{"Over another field, the characteristic polynomial must split into linear factors for this scalar-block statement. A real matrix with nonreal eigenvalues can be handled over $\\mathbb C$; a real canonical description instead uses different real blocks. Specify the field before claiming a real Jordan basis."}</p>
              </TheoryBox>
              <TheoryBox title={"Chains and the equation AP = PJ"}>
                <p>{"For an eigenvalue $\\lambda$, a generalized eigenvector is annihilated by some power of $N=A-\\lambda I$. A length-$m$ chain satisfies $Nv_1=0$, $Nv_2=v_1$, ..., $Nv_m=v_{m-1}$. The first vector must be nonzero. This implies $Av_j=\\lambda v_j+v_{j-1}$ for $j>1$."}</p>
                <p>{"Place a chain in the columns of $P$ in the order $v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_m$. The preceding equations become $AP=PJ$ for a block with superdiagonal ones. Reversing the columns changes the displayed convention. After assembling all chains, check that $P$ is invertible before writing $A=PJP^{-1}$."}</p>
                <p>{"Chain vectors are independent: if a linear combination of a single chain were zero, applying the highest useful power of $N$ isolates the coefficient of its last nonzero term. For several chains, their selection must jointly span the generalized eigenspace; arbitrary solutions chosen independently can create dependent columns."}</p>
              </TheoryBox>
              <TheoryBox title={"Reading block sizes from nullities"}>
                <p>{"The number of Jordan blocks for $\\lambda$ equals $d_1=\\dim\\ker(A-\\lambda I)$, its geometric multiplicity. Their sizes sum to its algebraic multiplicity. Let $d_k=\\dim\\ker(A-\\lambda I)^k$ and $d_0=0$. Then $d_k-d_{k-1}$ counts the blocks of size at least $k$."}</p>
                <p>{"A block of size $m$ contributes $\\min(k,m)$ to $d_k$, which proves the increment rule. Consequently the increments are nonincreasing, and $2d_k-d_{k-1}-d_{k+1}$ counts blocks of size exactly $k$. Compute nullities until they stabilize at the algebraic multiplicity."}</p>
                <p>{"The largest block size for $\\lambda$ is the exponent of $(t-\\lambda)$ in the minimal polynomial. The characteristic polynomial counts the total size instead. A matrix is diagonalizable exactly when every Jordan block has size one, equivalently when its minimal polynomial splits with no repeated linear factors."}</p>
