                <p>{"Given $PA=LU$, multiply $Ax=b$ by $P$ to obtain $LUx=Pb$. First solve $Ly=Pb$ by forward substitution; then solve $Ux=y$ by back substitution. With no permutation, $P=I$ and the first right-hand side is simply $b$."}</p>
                <p>{"For unit-diagonal $L$, forward substitution is $y_i=(Pb)_i-\\sum_{j<i}l_{ij}y_j$. Back substitution is $x_i=(y_i-\\sum_{j>i}u_{ij}x_j)/u_{ii}$, proceeding from the last equation upward. Each step uses values that have already been computed."}</p>
                <p>{"Dense factorization costs about $2n^3/3$ scalar operations to leading order. Once stored, the pair of triangular solves costs $O(n^2)$ per new right-hand side. This is useful for repeated circuit loads, structural load cases, and time-stepping problems with an unchanged coefficient matrix; forming $A^{-1}$ is generally unnecessary."}</p>
              </TheoryBox>
              <TheoryBox title={"Determinants and verification"}>
                <p>{"Because $\\det L=1$, the determinant follows from the diagonal of $U$ and the swaps. If $s$ row interchanges were made, $\\det A=(-1)^s\\prod_i u_{ii}$. Count swaps, not elimination steps; adding a multiple of one row to another does not change the determinant."}</p>
                <p>{"Check a factorization using $R=PA-LU$. In exact hand calculations $R$ should be zero. In floating point, examine a scaled residual such as $\\|R\\|/\\|A\\|$ for nonzero $A$. Separately check a computed solution with $r=b-A\\hat x$. A small residual alone does not guarantee a small forward error when $A$ is ill-conditioned."}</p>
                <p>{"Common mistakes are storing the negative of the multiplier, forgetting $Pb$, dividing by a zero pivot, swapping uncompleted entries of $L$, and refactorizing for every new $b$. Keep the factorization equation visible beside each calculation and verify the original system at the end."}</p>

              <TheoryBox title={"From elimination to factors"}>
                <p>{"A system $Ax=b$ is often solved by eliminating entries below successive pivots. LU retains the elimination work so the same matrix can be used with many different right-hand sides. In Doolittle form, $A=LU$: $L$ is unit lower triangular and $U$ is upper triangular. The diagonal normalization belongs to $L$; other conventions, such as Crout, normalize a different factor."}</p>
                <p>{"For a pivot $u_{kk}\\ne0$, eliminate entry $a_{ik}$ using $R_i\\leftarrow R_i-m_{ik}R_k$, where $m_{ik}=a_{ik}/u_{kk}$. Store $m_{ik}$, not its negative, in $l_{ik}$. Subtracting the multiple is already part of the row-operation rule. The inverse elementary matrix adds it back, explaining why the stored factor has this sign."}</p>
                <p>{"If no row swaps are needed, the elimination matrices satisfy $E_{n-1}\\cdots E_1A=U$. Reversing their actions gives $A=E_1^{-1}\\cdots E_{n-1}^{-1}U=LU$. Thus the factors describe the same linear map; factorization does not replace the original problem with an approximation in exact arithmetic."}</p>
              </TheoryBox>
              <TheoryBox title={"Existence, normalization, and uniqueness"}>
                <p>{"For a nonsingular square matrix, nonzero leading principal minors guarantee elimination without pivoting. The first $k\\times k$ leading block has determinant equal to the product of its first $k$ pivots. If one pivot vanishes, the ordinary no-swap procedure fails even though $A$ may still be invertible."}</p>
                <p>{"When a nonsingular unit-lower/upper factorization exists, it is unique. If $L_1U_1=L_2U_2$, then $L_2^{-1}L_1=U_2U_1^{-1}$. The left side is unit lower triangular and the right side upper triangular, so both must equal $I$. Without a diagonal convention, scaling can be transferred between the two factors."}</p>
                <p>{"Singular matrices may admit some LU factorization, but the nonsingular existence and unique-solve claims must not be applied to them unchanged. A zero final pivot indicates rank loss; it does not authorize dividing by zero. Return to consistency and rank analysis when solving a singular system."}</p>
              </TheoryBox>
              <TheoryBox title={"Pivoting and the meaning of P"}>
                <p>{"Partial pivoting selects a remaining row with maximal absolute entry in the current column. Record swaps in a permutation matrix $P$. Our convention is $PA=LU$, meaning the rows of $A$ have been reordered before their elimination history is represented by $L$ and $U$. Some software uses another convention, so check its documented equation."}</p>
                <p>{"At a later pivot, also exchange the corresponding rows in the already completed columns of $L$. Do not swap its entire rows indiscriminately: future columns and the unit diagonal are governed by the triangular structure. Keeping the permutation and multipliers consistent is essential to reconstruct $PA$."}</p>
                <p>{"Pivoting usually improves elimination stability by avoiding unnecessarily small pivots and controlling multipliers. It does not make an intrinsically sensitive matrix well-conditioned, and it is not a universal guarantee against all growth in floating-point arithmetic. Conditioning is studied separately in the final topic of this module."}</p>
